## How to contribute

### How to find a task

I'm using GitHub Issue for task management. Find the Issue you want to contribute here. Pull Requests without issues are fine. In that case, please provide details such as the reason, cause, and solution in the Pull Request.

### How to get started with a contribution

If you find a task you want to work on, comment on the Issue, such as "ðŸ™‹", to avoid duplicating work with others. We will react to the comments you received as soon as possible, but you can start the task after writing a comment on the Issue.
